## 📌 Overview

This ethical judgment framework simulates human-like ethical decision-making  
by implementing a **4-layer ego-based processing model** and a **recursive moral feedback loop.**  
It integrates emotion reception, reflective delay, alignment with internal values, and refined response.

## 🧱 Core Structure

### 🧩 4-Layer Ego Model (자아 계층 구조)
1. **Lower Self** (`저층위 자아`)  
   → Immediate emotional response to external stimuli  
2. **Mid Self** (`중간층위 자아`)  
   → Reflective awareness of emotional intensity and origin  
3. **Higher Self** (`고층위 자아`)  
   → Ethical judgment from high-level cognition  
4. **Observer Self** (`관찰자 자아`)  
   → Meta-evaluation of decisions and recursive feedback

---

### 🔄 Ethical Feedback Loop  
- **Affect → Delay → Alignment → Re-Affect**  
- 감응 → 유예 → 정렬 → 재감응  
This recursive loop mimics moral hesitation, adjustment, and ethical adaptation.
